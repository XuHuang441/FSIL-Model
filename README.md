Given an annotated JSON file, the script outputs the processed data in CoNLL format.

The continuation link is implemented, and the text it points to is directly appended to the original text with the same label. 

The 'O-' tag is also implemented, meaning that everything other than the labeled text is considered as 'O-'.

Place the JSON file and script in the same directory to generate the output.
